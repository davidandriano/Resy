- Test thoroughly before relying on it
- Have a backup plan for important reservations
- See MULTI_PLATFORM_GUIDE.md for limitations

### Browser Compatibility:

- Best viewed in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile-responsive design
- Gradients may look different in older browsers

## 🚀 Deployment to Streamlit Cloud

### If you want to use the new design:

1. **Rename files**:
   ```bash
   mv app.py app_old.py
   mv app_v2.py app.py
   ```

2. **Commit and push**:
   ```bash
   git add app.py
   git commit -m "Redesign: Modern UI, browse-first UX, platform-specific auth"
   git push -u origin claude/resy-reservation-bot-011CUUDJ5kg7ZJdfUQVC8utX
   ```

3. **Streamlit will auto-deploy** within 2-3 minutes

### To test both versions:

Keep both files and switch between them:
- `streamlit run app.py` - Old version
- `streamlit run app_v2.py` - New version

## 📊 Performance Improvements
