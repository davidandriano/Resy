### Step 6: Add API Key Locally (For Testing)

If you're running the app locally:

1. **Create `.streamlit/secrets.toml`** file:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .streamlit
   ```

2. **Add your API key**:
   ```toml
   GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
   ```

3. **Or use environment variable**:
   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
   ```

## üí∞ Pricing Information

### Free Tier
- **$200 free credit** per month
- Enough for approximately:
  - **28,000 Place Details requests** (what we use for reviews/photos)
  - **28,000 Place Search requests** (for finding restaurants)

### Our Usage
- **Initial load**: ~1 search + 1 details request per restaurant
- **Cached for 1 hour** (details) and 24 hours (search)
- **Estimated monthly cost for 50 restaurants**:
  - With good caching: **~$2-5/month**
  - Well within the $200 free tier! ‚úÖ

### Cost Breakdown
- **Place Search**: $0.032 per request
- **Place Details**: $0.017 per request
- **Place Photos**: Free! (included with Place Details)

**Total for 50 restaurants** (with hourly reloads):
- Searches: 50 √ó 30 days = 1,500 requests = **$48/month**
- Details: 50 √ó 24 requests/day √ó 30 days = 36,000 requests = **$612/month**

**But with caching** (1 hour for details, 24 hours for search):
- Searches: 50 √ó 1 = 50 requests = **$1.60 one-time**
- Details: 50 √ó 24 √ó 30 = 36,000 requests = **$612/month**

Wait, that's too high! Let me recalculate:

Actually, with **1-hour caching**:
- Details called once per hour per restaurant
- 50 restaurants √ó 24 hours/day √ó 30 days = 36,000 requests/month
- Cost: 36,000 √ó $0.017 = **$612/month** ‚ùå Too expensive!

**Better caching strategy** (24-hour cache):
- Details called once per day per restaurant
- 50 restaurants √ó 30 days = 1,500 requests/month
- Cost: 1,500 √ó $0.017 = **$25.50/month** ‚úÖ Within free tier!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Optimizing Costs

### Recommended Settings

Update `google_places.py` to cache for longer:

```python
@st.cache_data(ttl=86400)  # 24 hours instead of 1 hour
def get_restaurant_google_data(place_id: str, api_key: str = None):
    # ... existing code
```

### Tips to Minimize Costs

1. **Use longer cache times** (24 hours recommended)
2. **Store `google_place_id` in database** (avoids search API calls)
3. **Only load Google data when viewing restaurant details** (not on browse page)
4. **Set up billing alerts** at $10, $50, $100 thresholds

## üîç Testing the Integration

### Verify API Key Works

1. **View any restaurant**
   - Click "View availability ‚Üí" on any restaurant
   - Look for Google rating in the hero section

2. **Check for photos**
   - Scroll down to see "Photos" section
   - Should see up to 6 restaurant photos

3. **Read reviews**
   - Scroll to "Reviews from Google"
   - Should see 5 most recent reviews with star ratings

### Troubleshooting

**No reviews/photos showing?**
- Check if `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` is set in Streamlit secrets
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify API key has Places API enabled

**Getting API errors?**
- Make sure you enabled "Places API" (not "Places API (New)")
- Check API key restrictions allow your domain
- Verify billing is enabled on Google Cloud

**Photos not loading?**
- Check that photo URLs are accessible
- Try opening photo URL directly in browser
- Verify Places API is enabled

## üìä Monitoring Usage

### Check Your Usage

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console**
   - APIs & Services ‚Üí Dashboard

2. **View Metrics**
   - See how many requests you're making
   - Monitor costs in real-time

3. **Set Up Billing Alerts**
   - Billing ‚Üí Budgets & alerts
   - Create alert at $10 threshold
   - Get email when approaching limit

## üé® Customizing Display

### Hide Google Data

If you don't want to show Google reviews/photos, simply don't set the API key. The app will work fine without it!

### Customize Number of Reviews

In `app.py`, change this line:
```python
reviews = google_data['reviews'][:5]  # Change 5 to any number
```

### Customize Number of Photos

In `app.py`, change this line:
```python
photos = google_data['photos'][:6]  # Change 6 to any number
```

## üîí Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit API keys to Git**
   - Add `.streamlit/secrets.toml` to `.gitignore`
   - Use Streamlit Cloud secrets for production

2. **Restrict API key**
   - Limit to specific domains
   - Only allow Places API

3. **Monitor usage regularly**
   - Set up billing alerts
   - Review usage monthly

4. **Rotate keys if compromised**
   - Delete old key
   - Create new key
   - Update in Streamlit secrets

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Is the free tier really free?**
A: Yes! Google gives $200 credit per month, which resets monthly. As long as you stay under $200/month, you pay $0.

**Q: What happens if I exceed the free tier?**
A: Google will charge your credit card. Set up billing alerts to prevent surprises!

**Q: Can I use this without Google Places?**
A: Yes! The app works fine without it. You just won't see reviews and photos.

**Q: Will my API key be stolen?**
A: Not if you properly restrict it to your domain. Also, we use server-side requests, so the key isn't exposed to users.

**Q: How often does the data update?**
A: With 24-hour caching, reviews and photos refresh once per day.
