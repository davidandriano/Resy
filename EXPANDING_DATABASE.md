# Expanding Your Restaurant Database

Since Resy blocks automated API access, here are the best ways to expand your restaurant database:

## Option 1: Use the Web App "Add Restaurant" Tab (Easiest)

1. Open your Streamlit app
2. Go to the "Add Restaurant" tab
3. Enter restaurant details one by one
4. The app will automatically add them to the database

**How to find a Venue ID:**
1. Go to https://resy.com/cities/sf
2. Click on the restaurant you want
3. Right-click on the page and select "Inspect" (or press F12)
4. Press Ctrl+F (or Cmd+F) and search for `"venue_id"`
5. You'll see something like `"venue_id": 339` - that's your venue ID!

## Option 2: Batch Import from CSV (Fastest for Many Restaurants)

1. Edit the `sf_restaurants_sample.csv` file
2. Add restaurants in the format: `Name,VenueID,Neighborhood,Cuisine`
3. Run the batch import script:
   ```bash
   python batch_add_restaurants.py
   ```
4. Choose option 2 to import from CSV

**Example CSV format:**
```csv
State Bird Provisions,1505,Western Addition,American
Rich Table,3007,Hayes Valley,American
Zuni Cafe,795,Hayes Valley,Mediterranean
```

## Option 3: Interactive Command Line Tool

Run the batch script and choose option 1 to add restaurants interactively:

```bash
python batch_add_restaurants.py
```

This will prompt you for each restaurant's details.

## Finding Venue IDs - Detailed Steps

### Method 1: From Restaurant Page
1. Go to https://resy.com
2. Search for the restaurant
3. Click on the restaurant to open its page
4. Right-click anywhere and select "Inspect" (Chrome/Firefox) or "Inspect Element" (Safari)
5. In the developer tools, press Ctrl+F (Cmd+F on Mac)
6. Search for `venue_id`
7. You'll find lines like `"id":{"resy":339}` or `"venue_id":339`
8. The number is your venue ID!

### Method 2: From URL (Sometimes)
Some restaurant URLs include the venue ID:
- URL might look like: `https://resy.com/cities/sf/restaurant-name?venue_id=339`
- Or in the page source you might see: `resy://venue/339`

## Tips for Building Your Database

1. **Start with your favorites** - Add restaurants you actually want to book
2. **Add as you go** - When you discover a restaurant on Resy, add it to your database
3. **Share with others** - If you and your boyfriend both use the app, you can each add restaurants
4. **Neighborhoods** - Group by neighborhood (e.g., "Mission", "Hayes Valley", "Nob Hill")
5. **Cuisine types** - Use consistent categories (e.g., "Italian", "Japanese", "American")
